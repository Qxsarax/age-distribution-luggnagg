# age-distribution-luggnagg

Context and Objective of the Project

In a data-driven company, the ability to generate and manipulate realistic data is essential to:
-Simulate real scenarios.
-Support employee training.
-Test market hypotheses.
This project aims to create a realistic dataset using a spreadsheet, providing an effective tool for testing statistical analysis techniques and prediction models.

Project Description:

The company intends to generate random but meaningful data regarding the fictional population of Luggnagg. The main focus is:
-Normal distribution: Simulation of the age of a sample population of 250 individuals.
-Structured spreadsheet: Creation of specific sheets, each dedicated to statistical and data analysis concepts.

Main features:

-Data Generation: Automated production of random data based on statistical distributions.
-Dynamic visualization: Graphs and tables to quickly interpret data.
-Linear regression: Application of statistical models for the analysis of relationships between variables.
-Training and testing: A hands-on approach for employees learning to work with complex datasets.
